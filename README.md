API ATLAS
======

API Atals is a web interface for voting on which parts of the HTTP spec you use when designing APIs. It is hosted at [apiatlas.org](http://apiatlas.org).

We used a combination of less, purecss, node.js, and firebase to create this site. If you'd like to get your own copy running, make sure to set your own versions of the environment variables specified in config.js. REDIRECT is the oAuth callback used by your github application. 

This project was created as a followup to [a session](https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2013/wiki/What-can-we-use-from-HTTP%3F) at the 2013 [API Craft Conference](http://apicraft.org) which asked the question: "What should we be borrowing from the HTTP spec when designing apis?"
